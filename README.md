## Notes

The [Sunlight Foundation](https://sunlightfoundation.com/api/) has some great APIs. I figure this project will probably end up using the [Congress API V3](https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/) and the [Open States API](http://sunlightlabs.github.io/openstates-api/). The [League of Women Voters](http://hq-salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/5950/getLocal.jsp?zip=95746&zip4=) has great data all the way down to city and county-level representatives, but I'm not sure where their data source comes from.
